## Minimal Waybar Themes 

## Compatibility
- These configs are Omarchy-based, including optional Omarchy-specific modules (logo, screen recorder, update module).
- Aside from that, they use standard modules so they can be used on any distro by simply removing the Omarchy modules and set your own color scheme.

## Installation
#### Just run this command and select the version you want to install (gum should be installed inorder to run the installer.)    
   ```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atif-1402/minimal-waybar-themes/main/install.sh | bash
```
#### Backup of your current waybar created in ~/.config/waybar.bak.(timestamps) folder automatically via install.sh
#### Script become executable automatically no need to hunt chmod +x damn.sh

## V1
This is the first waybar theme version and i try my best to update it and make more themes like this
<img width="1366" height="31" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abe6a97e-c4d3-4159-aaa3-d1c19cd7d1c6" />

### Basic features this waybar provide 
 - Minimal workspace switcher
 - Middle minimal clock
 - System Tray
 - Volume (pulseaudio) indicator
 - Media player - this is a custom module it requires playerctl
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S playerctl
   ```
   
### Making Media player work
![ezgif-54295365b2a3790a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee6b1982-560e-4a0f-b83f-57288c5c5370)
- As i said playerctl is required for this and a Script file i also added the media.sh file in waybar/media.sh 
- To make it work seamlessly you need Nerd Fonts for the play/pause icon in the media
- Place the media.sh folder in your waybar folder to work
